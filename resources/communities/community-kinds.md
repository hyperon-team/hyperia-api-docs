# Community kinds

The community that you built might be based on a wide variety of platforms. Whenever this will be a gaming Discord server, an amazing GitHub project or just a website. Hyperia supports most popular of them. Our main goal was to an advertisement platform not only for a single platform, but give people ability to advertise their websites, projects or communities wherever they are built.

Here is currently supported community platforms:

| Platform | Representation in API |
| :--- | :--- |
| Discord | `0x1` |
| VK \(VKontake\) | `0x2` |
| FB \(Facebook\) | `0x4` |
| Custom websites | `0x5` |

In the future the list will increase. Feel free to suggest a platform in our feedback page, or in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Hz5GMFS).
